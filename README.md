# Golden Grades

Golden Grades is a web application to visualize historical grade distributions by course and instructor for Marquette University. This repository contains the project documentation, design artifacts, templates, and safe scaffolding so contributors can begin work while waiting for access to production registrar data.

This repository will hold:
- Design and architecture documentation
- FERPA & privacy guidance
- ETL plan and a sample ETL script template
- Database schema SQL and an OpenAPI contract stub
- Contribution and community templates (issue/PR templates, contributing guide, code of conduct)
- CI workflow placeholder and .env example
